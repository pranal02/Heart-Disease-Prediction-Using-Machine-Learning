# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
# Project Overview
- This project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict the risk of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics. Using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, we implement and compare three classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The project includes data analysis, visualization, model building, evaluation, and selection of the best model based on performance metrics.

# Dataset
- Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- Description: The dataset contains 14 attributes, with the target attribute indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. The features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and more.
